# DicomEditor
This is a simple dicom editor tool used to query tags and modify tag values, and display the images.
I think it's helpful in some simple cases, and make sure not expect too much since I just took a few hours to do this.
You can drag a .dcm file or a folder to the page, and the program will display the tag information.
The program runs depending on .Net6.0 runtime.
